Brute Force Attack Demonstration (Educational)

This project demonstrates a dictionary-based brute force attack in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux against a Metasploitable2 target (Telnet service). The goal is to educate about cybersecurity risks and defenses.

- PDF Report: Full penetration testing report following PTES methodology
- Key Steps:
  - Reconnaissance (nmap, nbtscan)
  - Exploitation (Hydra brute force)
  - Post-exploitation (backdoor creation)
  - Mitigation (UFW firewall, strong passwords)
- Screenshots: Proof-of-concept images

Legal Disclaimer
- For educational/research purposes ONLY
- Requires explicit permission for testing
- Unauthorized hacking is illegal

Defense Strategies Covered
1. Disabling Telnet/using SSH
2. Password policies (length/complexity)
3. Account lockouts and Fail2Ban
4. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
5. Firewall rules (UFW)
